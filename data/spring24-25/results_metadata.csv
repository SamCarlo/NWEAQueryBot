Items that are not scored, such as field test and familiarity items, are not included in the calculation. This field provides an additional reference point for those assessing the confidence level of a test event's RIT score. When approximately 40% to 60% of items are answered correctly, the student’s responses are consistent with the adaptive test model and the level of confidence in the validity of the RIT score is increased. Used in conjunction with the test duration and standard error of measure, the percent correct can identify test event scores that may be suspect. A test event with too many items answered correctly (for example, more than 60%) can be an indicator that the test was not well targeted for the student’s performance level. In other words, the items presented were not sufficiently appropriate for the student’s level of proficiency (generally too easy). A test event with too few items answered correctly can be an indicator that the student was not fully engaged. For example, the student may have given random answers to questions or may have purposely answered questions incorrectly.","Percentage of questions the student completed with rapid guesses, which are well below the average response time measured by NWEA for each test question.","Projected RIT growth from previous academic year fall term to the fall term chosen at export.
